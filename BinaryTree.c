/*/Inserts a sequence of integers into a Max-Heap stored in an array - void insert(int item)
Prints the heap after each insertion - void showHeap(void)
Removes the maximum element (the root) K times, reheapifies downward each time, and prints the heap after each removal - int removeMax(void) & void reHeapDown(int i)
Provides a function to print each node with its left/right children (using indices) to reinforce the array-as-tree mapping. ???/*/
